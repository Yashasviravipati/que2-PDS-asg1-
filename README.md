Student Performance Analysis

Overview

This project analyzes student performance using the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset. The analysis includes various visualizations to understand trends, distributions, and relationships between different performance factors.

Steps to Run the Analysis

Load the dataset: Ensure that StudentsPerformance.csv is uploaded.

Install necessary libraries (if not already installed):
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

Run the visualizations included in analysis.ipynb:

Histogram: Distribution of math scores.

Boxplot: Reading scores by gender.

Heatmap: Correlation between different subject scores.

Boxplot: Math scores based on parental education level.

Violin Plot: Writing scores based on lunch type.

Save the results: Export visualizations if needed.

Insights from Visualizations

Score Distributions: Helps understand student performance spread.

Gender-Based Performance: Compares male and female reading scores.

Correlation Analysis: Identifies relationships between subjects.

Parental Influence: Examines impact of education on scores.

Lunch & Performance: Determines if nutrition affects writing scores.
